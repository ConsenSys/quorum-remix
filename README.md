The Quorum plugin for Ethereum's Remix IDE adds support for creating and interacting with private contracts on a Quorum network.

## Getting Started

Just go to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and activate the **Quorum Network** plugin on the plugins page. For step-by-step instructions, go to the [Getting Started](https://medium.com/remix-ide/quorum-plugin-for-remix-ee232ebca64c) doc.

## Common Issues
**Firefox CORS Issues:**
- Firefox seems to be a little more strict than Chrome at the moment about making cross-origin http requests on https pages. Remix currently loads our plugin in an iframe from an HTTPS url, but our users are frequently running their Quorum node on an HTTP localhost url. The latest Chrome release seems to allow these calls, but Firefox will block them and report a CORS error. We are tracking this issue in #8, but until that is fixed please use Chrome or another browser that doesn't block these requests.
